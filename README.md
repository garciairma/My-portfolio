Used Bootstrap CSS to create a mobile responsive portfolio. I built this by creating three different folders and naming them as follows: index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html. 

After that I worked on creating the navbar for each page and that About, Contact and Portfolio each had a clickable link with its own URL. This was probably the most difficult part of this project.

Once the navbar was done I worked on the about me and added a picute of myself as well as the about me. I had to resize my image as it was too large, I also had to move my text to the right as it kept going under my image. Then I added some <br> in my paragraph and I really liked how it looked with extra spacing, it felt easier on the eyes.

Next I worked on the contact page and was able to locate the template I wanted to use in bootstrap. The submit button was not included in the template so I had to google how to add a submit button within the contact page

Then I worked on my portfolio - I searched for stock images in google and added pictures of nature. The picutes were vertical and there was no spacing between them. I had to create a div class container as well as a class row to seperate the images - this also aligned the images horizontally. 

Finally I worked on the footer and tried to make it stick to the bottom - although it stays at the bottom its fixed higher than I would like. I tried adding <br> to push it down but what I found was that when I was testing the responsiveness of the footer it dissapeared at certain lenghts. I also added my name within the footer.

Once I was done I tested everything to make sure it worked.

Went back in and was able to fix footer at bottom by adding a class of fixed-bottom, was also able to center my name in the footer by adding class text-center.

The reason my color wasn't working was because I was trying to add this <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-info text-white">.bg-info</div> instead of just adding the class bg-info within the section.
